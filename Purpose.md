# TCS-Project

## Project Overview

This robust database management system is tailored to support remote agricultural operations and stakeholders. This project is designed with the flexibility and scalability needed to manage agricultural data across various environments, from small-scale farms to large agricultural enterprises. By automating database operations, the project empowers farmers and stakeholders to focus on critical decision-making rather than technical database management.

### Key Features

* **Remote Configuration Management:**
  * Centralized database configuration (`config/database-config.yaml`) and environment-specific settings (`config/env/`) enable seamless management across different farm locations, whether local or cloud-based. This is crucial for stakeholders who need consistent access to data without physical presence.
* **Automated Database Initialization:**
  * The `scripts/init-db.sh` script simplifies the setup of the database schema, allowing for quick deployment of essential data structures. This is particularly beneficial in remote settings where technical expertise may be limited.
* **Reliable Backup and Recovery:**
  * With the `scripts/backup-db.sh` script, farmers can schedule automated backups to ensure that their critical data, such as crop yields, weather patterns, and sales records, is always safe. The ability to restore data quickly via `scripts/restore-db.sh` minimizes downtime and data loss in case of system failures.
* **Seamless Database Migrations:**
  * The `scripts/migrate-db.sh` script helps manage schema changes, ensuring that updates to the database structure do not disrupt ongoing operations. This is vital for scaling operations or integrating new data sources in a growing farm network.
* **Efficient Data Seeding:**
  * Initial data seeding through `scripts/seed-db.sh` allows for populating the database with necessary data such as standard crop types, soil quality data, and regional weather conditions. This feature is crucial for setting up new farming operations quickly.

### Directory Structure

* **`config/`:**
  * Stores database and environment configurations, ensuring that all stakeholders, regardless of location, operate with consistent settings.
* **`scripts/`:**
  * Includes essential shell scripts for managing the database lifecycle, from initialization to backups and migrations, making it easy for non-technical users to maintain data integrity.
* **`docs/`:**
  * Contains detailed documentation, including an architecture overview and setup guide, to assist remote operators in understanding and maintaining the system. The `setup-guide.md` is particularly useful for those setting up the system in areas with limited technical support.
* **`sql/`:**
  * Houses SQL scripts that define the core data structures (e.g., `sql/tables/create_customers_table.sql` and `sql/views/create_customer_orders_view.sql`), enabling the systematic organization of data crucial for farm management.
* **`tests/`:**
  * Provides SQL test scripts to validate the integrity of the database setup, ensuring that all functionalities work as intended even in remote deployments.
* **`Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`:**
  * Facilitate containerized deployment, allowing the entire system to run consistently across various environments. This is particularly beneficial for remote deployments where infrastructure may vary.

### Use Cases for Remote Farmers and Stakeholders

* **Data Consistency Across Multiple Locations:**
  * By centralizing the database management through this system, stakeholders can ensure that all data from different farms or regions is consistent and accessible, supporting better decision-making.
* **Reduced Dependency on Technical Expertise:**
  * The automation of database tasks (initialization, backup, migration) reduces the need for technical staff, making it easier for farmers to focus on their primary work while ensuring their data is managed effectively.
* **Disaster Recovery in Remote Areas:**
  * Automated backups and easy restoration processes are essential for farms located in areas prone to natural disasters. This ensures that critical agricultural data is never lost and can be quickly recovered.
